# StructureSaverWeb

Web based frontend and backend for [StructureSaver mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1757259514) for the game Ark:Survival Evolved.

The StructureSaver mod allows players to save buildings (made of structure pieces) as plans, and then use those plans to create copies of the original buildings. This repository contains a backend for the mod to manage sharing the plans across multiple ARK:Survival Evolved game servers. Also present in this repository is a web-based frontend to manage the plans, some additional features not present in the mod, and related settings.
